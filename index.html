					<div id="first-line">I have this image of you:</div>
				</div><br/><br/>
				<strong>
					Quiet and reposed,<br/>
					Over the thick nickel river crossings of Saskatchewan,<br/>
					Ears dipped in sulfur run-off from the salt mines on high,<br/>
					Your form refracted in milky saffron.<br/>
				</strong>
			</div><br />

			<div class="p-second">
				“Tastes real rusty,” Charon says, anchored by your silence,<br/>
				“Well I am here, play for me. I can pay.<br/>
				“Maybe another day,” you politely nod, outside of the sunlight<br/>
			</div><br/>

			<div class="p-third">
				And off he swivels away, into the horizon’s silver.<br/> 
				I shiver along winter’s hips, walking lost in the ivory city,<br/>
				Until the trails led me to your door, and the couch was warm. <br/>
				“I share my songs with no one,” you told me, eyes trained<br/>
				Above the rabble. And it took nearly a year before you cracked,<br/> 
				And in the last breath of sunset, you voice chanted for me<br/> 
				A melody in search of syllables.
			</div><br/>

			<div class="p-fourth">
				“I can rhyme,” I think I stammered,
				But you smiled. “Let’s give it a try.” And everything un-musical was erased.
			</div><br/>

			<div class="p-fifth">
				What was perfect on the page would embarrass on the stage.<br/> 
				As Caicai-Vilu and Trentren-Vilu failed to rebuild the world<br/>
				After the waste of terrain and language.<br/>
