			<strong>
				<p>I have this image of you:</p>
				<p>Quiet and reposed,</p>
				<p>Over the thick nickel river crossings of Saskatchewan,</p>
				<p>Ears dipped in sulfur run-off from the salt mines on high,</p>
				<p>Your form refracted in milky saffron.</p>
			</strong>

		<div id="sask-bg"></div>
		<p>“Tastes real rusty,” Charon says, anchored by your silence,</p> 
		<p>“Well I am here, play for me. I can pay.”</p>
		<p>“Maybe another day,” you politely nod, outside of the sunlight,<p>
			<p>And off he swivels away, into the horizon’s silver.<p> 
				<p>I shiver along winter’s hips, walking lost in the ivory city,<p>
					<p>Until the trails led me to your door, and the couch was warm.<p> 
						<p>“I share my songs with no one,” you told me, eyes trained<p> 
							<p>Above the rabble. And it took nearly a year before you cracked,<p> 
								<p>And in the last breath of sunset, you voice chanted for me<p> 
									<p>A melody in search of syllables.<p> 
										<p>“I can rhyme,” I think I stammered,<p>
											<p>But you smiled. “Let’s give it a try.” And everything un-musical was erased.</p>
											<p>What was perfect on the page would embarrass on the stage.<p> 
												<p>As Caicai-Vilu and Trentren-Vilu failed to rebuild the world<p>
													<p>After the waste of terrain and language.<p>
