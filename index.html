			<p>I have this image of you:</p>
			<p>Quiet and reposed,</p>
			<p>Over the thick nickel river crossings of Saskatchewan,</p>
			<p>Ears dipped in sulfur run-off from the salt mines on high,</p>
			<p>Your form refracted in milky saffron.</p>
		</div>
 				“Tastes real rusty,” Charon says, anchored by your silence,<br/> 
 				“Well I am here, play for me. I can pay.”<br/> 
		“Maybe another day,” you politely nod, outside of the sunlight,<br/>
		And off he swivels away, into the horizon’s silver.<br/> 
		I shiver along winter’s hips, walking lost in the ivory city,<br/>
		Until the trails led me to your door, and the couch was warm.<br/> 
		“I share my songs with no one,” you told me, eyes trained<br/> 
		Above the rabble. And it took nearly a year before you cracked,<br/> 
		And in the last breath of sunset, you voice chanted for me 
		A melody in search of syllables.<br/> 
						“I can rhyme,” I think I stammered,<br/>
		But you smiled. “Let’s give it a try.” And everything un-musical was erased.<br/> 
		What was perfect on the page would embarrass on the stage.<br/> 

		As Caicai-Vilu and Trentren-Vilu failed to rebuild the world<br/>
		After the waste of terrain and language.<br/>
